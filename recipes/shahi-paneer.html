    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        When we were kids, whenever my parents went out to an adults-only party, my mother asked us what we wanted for
        dinner at home. Ninety-nine percent of the time, our choice was pooris and shahi paneer. My mother was always
        nice enough to oblige. Here is the recipe. It is quite rich, hence a nice treat.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder</li>
        <li>4 tomatoes, puréed</li>
        <li>8 ounces paneer, cubed</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook until onion soft and golden brown,
            about 5 minutes. Season with cumin, coriander, turmeric, and chili powder; cook until fragrant, about 30
            seconds.
        </li>

        <li>
            Add puréed tomatoes to the skillet; cook until excess liquid evaporates and oil separates, 3 to 5 minutes.
            Add paneer, water, sugar, and salt; stir gently so paneer does not break apart. Cook until paneer absorbs
            some liquid, about 10 minutes. Stir in cream; simmer 5 minutes. Garnish servings with cilantro.
        </li>
    </ol>
